                      <p>  The idea is to provide a platform where people can donate goods as well as needy people accept them  .  Any user has an option to donate or to receive. </p>
                      <p> The user may put up any item such as clothes,essential needs, up for donation.  The user may also view all items available for give away, and request to receive it.  After selecting a particular item, the receiver will get an option to call the giver to continue the process or a cancel option to cancel the request.</p>  
                    
                    <p>  Another option available is Donation for NGO.  The donor can send a request to donate to the available causes.  The agency can accept the request.  After the request is accepted, contact information will  be exchanged between the sides.  Either side can contact the either to confirm the drop off.We are partnered with multiple NGOs to allow you to 
                      give back to the community in an informed and precise manner.</p>
